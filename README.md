This Docker container listens on port 80 and allows to proxy any internal or external website.

For example, the container can be used to make a device on the local network available on the internet without exposing it directly.

The container is meant to be used with another reverse proxy which handles encryption (e.g. [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy/)).

# Features

- Allows proxying any website via HTTP and HTTPS

- HTTP Basic authentication as an additional layer of security

- Small and lightweight

- Fully configurable via environment variables

- Available on AMD64, i386, ARMv6 and ARM64

# Usage

You have to set at least `PROXY_URL`.

**Example:** `$ docker run -d -e PROXY_URL=https://example.com schmailzl/simple-reverse-proxy`

## Environment variables

* `PROXY_URL` - The url you want to proxy including the protocol

* `PROXY_SSL_VERIFY` - If set to "off", the container will not check the SSL certificate of the proxied server when using HTTPS. (default: "on") 

* `PROXY_REPLACE_URL` - If set, the container will replace references to the proxied URL in the HTML response with this URL.

* `ADDITIONAL_CONFIG` - Additional nginx location configuration

#### HTTP authentication

HTTP Basic authentication will be enabled if you set `PROXY_AUTH_USER` and/or `PROXY_AUTH_FILE`.

* `PROXY_AUTH_USER` - The username you have to enter when trying to connect

* `PROXY_AUTH_PASSWORD` - The password you have to enter when trying to connect

* `PROXY_AUTH_MESSAGE` - The message the browser will show when trying to connect (default: "Please login:")

* `PROXY_AUTH_FILE` - If you don't want to set the authentication credentials by environment variables, you can bind your own htpasswd file to the container and set the new path. (default: "/etc/nginx/.htpasswd")

## Docker Compose

The container is meant to be used with another reverse proxy which handles encryption (e.g. [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy/)).

A sample docker-compose.yml could look like this:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  proxy:
    image: schmailzl/simple-reverse-proxy
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      VIRTUAL_HOST: mydomain.com
      PROXY_URL: http://192.168.178.1
      PROXY_REPLACE_URL: https://mydomain.com
```
